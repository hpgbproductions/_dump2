# INTE4A

This is an educational tool that performs discrete integration over a domain on the xy-plane. It can be used to check the approximate answers of a problem. It also includes a function to bruteforce integer "answers", if the form of the answer is known.

Requires Processing. Tested on Processing 4.3.

### Usage Instructions

1. Identify the domain curves and the bounding box, and fill in the appropriate variables.
2. Select an appropriate resolution for the discrete integration. The values should be at least 500.
3. Choose the values for the color scale. The minimum, middle, and maximum values will be displayed as blue, red, and yellow respectively.
4. Enter your function, which will be used as z = f(x, y).
5. If the form of the answers is known, enter the parameters for bruteforcing. Otherwise, set NumAnswerConstants to 0.
6. Click on the "Run" button.
